 In NetworkRouter have EndPoint , which he uses to request and as soon as a request is completed, the result of this request is transmitted to the circuit NetworkRouterCompletion . The protocol also has a cancel function , which can be used to interrupt long-term load and unload requests. We also used associatedtype here because we want our Router to support any type of EndPointType . Without the use of associatedtype, the router would have to have some specific type implementing EndPointType

     This function is responsible for converting our query parameters. Since our API assumes the use of bodyParameters in the form of JSON and URLParameters converted to the URL format, we simply pass the appropriate parameters to the corresponding conversion functions, which we described at the beginning of the article. If you use an API that includes various types of encodings, then in this case I would recommend adding HTTPTask optional enumeration with encoding type. This listing should contain all possible types of encodings. After that, in configureParameters add one more argument with this enumeration. Depending on its value, switch using switch and make the encoding you need
